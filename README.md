# Polling application

---

Tools: TypeScript, Next.js, FaunaDB, Mantine UI

The project consists of 3 parts: Frontend as —Ålient, Backend as server and Route handler as pages.

---

Frontend part of the application is based on the [FSD-architecture](https://feature-sliced.design/).

Backend part of applicaton is my own vision of onion architecture.
